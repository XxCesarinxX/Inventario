# Nebula Pandas Theme for VS Code

The lovely Nebula Theme by `ChirtleLovesDolls` with a little touch of `pandas`.

It basically colorizes `.loc`, `.iloc`, and some other `pandas` methods and functions in order to fully enjoy this wonderful theme with `pandas`!

All the functionality of the original is there, as mentioned, it's just modified to be compatible with `pandas`. That's it!

If you want to see any scope added to this theme, just let me know! You can see your unmodified scopes using VSCode's built-in `Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes`. After that, I'm happy to add your suggestion to this theme, or you can just apply that setting to your `settings.json` file.
